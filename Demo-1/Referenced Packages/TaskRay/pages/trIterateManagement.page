    <span>TaskRay version 1.276 introduced a new checkbox field on the Task object called Completed (API Name: TASKRAY__trCompleted__c). This field will allow users to track and report on a completed status across multiple business processes.<br/><br/>
    During the upgrade process TaskRay automatically migrated existing tasks in the last columm to this Completed status. If this operation failed, it is possible to manually run the migration from this page.</span><br/><br/>
