If you are writing a workflow on a highly active object where records change in and out of meeting criteria, and each time criteria are met you need the workflow actions to fire, do not select this option. You must select Option 3 for records that may meet your criteria more than 1 time over the full lifespan of a record.

            Evaluates every record on the target object seeking to identify any record that meets your rule criteria, regardless if 
            that record has been edited or not. All records are evaluated every time the workflow engine runs. And every time the workflow 
            engine runs and a record is found to meet your criteria, the Workflow Actions will execute. This can cause proliferating 
            Workflow Actions if you have written rules that do not close the loop. 
            <ul class="ul">
                
            </ul>
            <p class="p">With this option, your workflow actions can run multiple times per record, as long as the criteria are met. 
            This means that once the criteria are met, even if the record isn't modified before the workflow engine runs again, your 
            workflow actions will execute again and again, until the criteria are no longer met. To avoid executing the same Workflow 
            Action repeated, here are a few simple steps you can use to help close the loop on your Rule Criteria and prevent proliferating Workflow Actions:</p>

<p><b>Field Updates</b>:</p> <ol>
Make sure you use the same field that is being updated as one of your WF Rule filters, and use the operator "NOT EQUAL TO". As an example, 
let's say the objective of your new Workflow Rule is to update "Field B" to "Completed" anytime "Field A" is no longer blank. Here is 
an example of how you might want to configure your Workflow Rule to close the loop on your Workflow Rule:
<p></p>
<li>Field B NOT EQUAL TO "Completed"; AND</li>
<li>Field A EQUAL "Null" (FYI: Do not type the word null as your value. Instead, just leave the value field blank)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Email Alerts</b>:</p> <ol>
<li>Create a new Checkbox field on the same object that your Workflow Rule is based on and name it in a way that clearly supports the Workflow 
Action you want to deliver. For example, lets say your Email Alert is related to sending an invoice notification to the Operations team. You 
might create a new checkbox field named "Invoice Notification Sent" </li>
<li>When you write your Workflow Rule, add your new Checkbox Field as one of the filters on your Workflow Rule Criteria. i.e. Checkbox Field EQUALS "False" </li>
<li>Add a new Field Update to update this new field at the same time that your Email Alert is sent </li>
<li>Build a WF Rule that updates this new Checkbox field to False, whenever your Workflow Rule Criteria is no longer met. </li>
</ol><p><b>New Task</b>: </p>
<oL>
<li>Create a New Checkbox Field that supports your workflow. "Task Created" </li>
<li>Build a WF Rule that updates this new Checkbox field to False, whenever your Workflow Rule Criteria is no longer met. This will deselect 
"Task Created", so in the future, on this record, if the criteria are met again, WF will create another Task.</li>
